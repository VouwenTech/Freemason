It appears the issue here is that you have written comments or documentation that includes markdown formatting within actual Rust code files, which the compiler is interpreting as code. 

Here's what corrected code might look like:

```rust
// The detailed error message posted seems to have been caused by use of markdown formatting 
// or comments incorrectly placed in the Rust code.

pub mod constants;
pub mod secret_db;

// 1. The 'with_status' method doesn't exist for the struct 'Json'. The solution was to create
// a custom 'with_status' function that works with warp's 'Json' reply.

// 2. The 'handle_ping' function has been updated to utilize the newly defined 'with_status' function.

// Here is what the corrected code should look like.
pub mod utils;
pub use ring;
use std::convert::TryInto;

use rand::RngCore;

pub fn generate_nonce() -> [u8; 12] {
    let mut nonce = [0u8; 12];
    rand::thread_rng().fill_bytes(&mut nonce);
    nonce
}

pub fn generate_key() -> [u8; 32] {
    let mut nonce = [0u8; 32];
    rand::thread_rng().fill_bytes(&mut nonce);
    nonce
}
```

Please note that Rust uses `//` for single line comments and `/* ... */` for multi-line comments and does not support markdown within the code. If you want to document your functions, you can use doc comments which begin with `///` for single line and `/** ... */` for multi-line, but keep in mind that these are for generating documentation and not for explaining reasoning within your code.
