The error message seems to be an incorrect representation of an actual error that was produced by the program. It seems like a misinterpretation of the compiler's output that was manually inserted into the source code. Therefore, it is impossible to fix the error from this context unless the actual source code is provided.

Also, there is a recommendation to check several unnamed functions that are possibly not found in their respective scopes, but without the proper code context, it's impossible to suggest a specific fix.

In general, if the problem is indeed due to incorrect usage of single quotes (`''`) and backticks/grave accents (``), they should be used correctly as per the Rust documentation guidelines. 

Here is a suggestion based on the provided code:

```rust
pub mod constants;
pub mod secret_db;
pub mod security;
pub mod sign_db;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug, Clone)]
pub struct DbError {
    pub message: String,
}

impl warp::reject::Reject for DbError {}


use rand::RngCore;

/// Generate a nonce
pub fn generate_nonce() -> [u8; 12] {
    let mut nonce = [0u8; 12];
    rand::thread_rng().fill_bytes(&mut nonce);
    nonce
}

/// Generate a key
pub fn generate_key() -> [u8; 32] {
    let mut nonce = [0u8; 32];
    rand::thread_rng().fill_bytes(&mut nonce);
    nonce
}


pub mod utils;
pub use ring;
use std::convert::TryInto;
```

Please provide more context or the exact error trace for a more accurate solution.
