As an AI model, I don't have direct access to the original file content you refer to in your question, and without that, I can't generate a concrete example of how the updated file content should look after implementing CORS and the OPTIONS HTTP method. However, I can provide a general example of how you can implement the OPTIONS method and CORS in a Node.js application using the Express.js framework.

Assuming you're adding it to an existing Node.js/Express.js application, you'd modify something like the following:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

...

app.get('/some/path', (req, res) => {
    ...
    res.send('Hello from GET');
});

app.post('/some/path', (req, res) => {
    ...
    res.send('Hello from POST');
});
```

Into:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();

app.use(cors());

...

app.options('/some/path', (req, res) => {
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, OPTIONS');
    res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type');
    res.send();
});

app.get('/some/path', (req, res) => {
    ...
    res.send('Hello from GET');
});

app.post('/some/path', (req, res) => {
    ...
    res.send('Hello from POST');
});
```

In this example, the OPTIONS method for the /some/path endpoint was implemented, and CORS was added to all routes. The OPTIONS handler sets Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers headers to indicate what methods and headers it will accept from cross-origin requests. Use appropriate header settings as per your own application requirements.
